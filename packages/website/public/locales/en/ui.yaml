user_settings_camera: Camera
user_settings_dynamic_light_quality: Light Quality
user_settings_dynamic_light_quality_description: >
  You can reduce overall dynamic light quality for better performance. With
  lower settings less light sources will be rendered in the scene. Disabling
  this means that every object will be uniformly highlighted and there will
  be no light sources that cast shadows.

user_settings_rendering_resolution_description: >
  You can reduce the rendering pixel ratio to decrease the rendering
  resolution, which makes everyting more blurry, but increases the performance.

user_settings_shadow_map_size: Shadow Map Size
user_settings_shadow_map_size_description: >
  Bigger values improve shadows quality, but affect performance and memory
  usage.
user_settings_show_rendering_stats: Show Rendering Stats
user_settings_show_rendering_stats_description: >
  Primarily used by game developers, but you can check your actual framerate
  and memory usage if you want to fine-tune your settings and you know what you
  are doing.
user_settings_use_offscreen_canvas: Use Offscreen Canvas
user_settings_use_offscreen_canvas_description: >
  This one is tricky. On faster devices it provides even better and snappier
  experience but on slower devices it can degrade the overall performance and
  introduce some graphical glitches. Overall you can safely turn this on and
  see if it makes a difference for you.
user_settings_use_shadows: Use Shadows
user_settings_use_shadows_description: >
  If you are not using multiple light sources you can disable this option as
  well since it will provide almost no visual enhancements without dynamic
  lighting.

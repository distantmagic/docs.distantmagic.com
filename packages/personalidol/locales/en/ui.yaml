user_settings_rendering_resolution: Rendering Resolution
user_settings_rendering_resolution_description: >

  usage.

user_settings_show_rendering_stats_description: >
  Primarily used by game developers, but you can check your actual framerate
  and memory usage if you want to fine-tune your settings and you know what you
  are doing.
user_settings_use_multiple_light_sources: Use Multiple Light Sources
user_settings_use_multiple_light_sources_description: >
  Can greatly affect performance. If you disable multiple light sources,
  background light will have more intensity and everything will be uniformly
  highlighted.
user_settings_use_offscreen_canvas: Use Offscreen Canvas
user_settings_use_offscreen_canvas_description: >
  This one is tricky. On faster devices it provides even better and snappier
  experience but on slower devices it can degrade the overall performance and
  introduce some graphical glitches. Overall you can safely turn this on and
  see if it makes a difference for you.
user_settings_use_shadows: Use Shadows
user_settings_use_shadows_description: >
  If you are not using multiple light sources you can disable this option as
  well since it will provide almost no visual enhancements without dynamic
  lighting.
